                   ·:  Spectating Script v1.03 for ArmA 2 :·
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Spectating script for Armed Assault multiplayer mission designers.

The spectating script allows dead players to spectate other players, replacing
the default seagull mode. 

To use the Spectating Script in your mission do the following:
- If you do not already have init.sqf or description.ext files made for the
  mission then you can just copy the contents of files directory directly to
  the mission directory.

Otherwise do the following:
- Copy the files\spect directory into your mission directory (So that the
  spect directory remains)
- Add the contents of files\init.sqf to your mission init.sqf file so that the 
  spectating script init is run at the beginning of mission
- Copy files\onPlayerRespawnAsSeagull.sqs to the mission directory
- Add the contents of files\description.ext to your mission description.ext

The spectating script should now launch whenever a player would normally go
to seagull mode. To test the script in the editor you can execute the following
in a radio trigger:
foo = [player, player, "null"] execVM "f\common\f_spect\specta.sqf"

Note! If you need to do any modifications into the spectating script files for
your mission, please mark the modified files as modified by you to avoid 
confusing them with the originals.
